 * Testcase Example:  '[1,1,2,2,3,3]'
 *
 * Alice has n candies, where the i^th candy is of type candyType[i]. Alice
 * noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.
 * 
 * The doctor advised Alice to only eat n / 2 of the candies she has (n is
 * always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the
 * maximum number of different types of candies while still following the
 * doctor's advice.
 * 
 * Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of
 * different types of candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2 of them.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Alice can only eat 6 / 2 = 3 candies. Since there are only 3
 * types, she can eat one of each type.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: candyType = [1,1,2,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Whether she eats types
 * [1,2], [1,3], or [2,3], she still can only eat 2 different types.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: candyType = [6,6,6,6]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Even though she can eat 2
 * candies, she only has 1 type.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == candyType.length
 * 2 <= n <= 10^4
 * nÂ is even.
 * -10^5 <= candyType[i] <= 10^5
 *
