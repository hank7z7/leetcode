 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,2],[2,5],[4,3]]'
 *
 * There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array customers,
 * where customers[i] = [arrivali, timei]:
 *
 *
 * arrivali is the arrival time of the i^th customer. The arrival times are
 * sorted in non-decreasing order.
 * timei is the time needed to prepare the order of the i^th customer.
 *
 *
 * When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts
 * preparing it once he is idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes
 * preparing his order. The chef does not prepare food for more than one
 * customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they
 * were given in the input.
 *
 * Return the average waiting time of all customers. Solutions within 10^-5
 * from the actual answer are considered accepted.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: customers = [[1,2],[2,5],[4,3]]
 * Output: 5.00000
 * Explanation:
 * 1) The first customer arrives at time 1, the chef takes his order and starts
 * preparing it immediately at time 1, and finishes at time 3, so the waiting
 * time of the first customer is 3 - 1 = 2.
 * 2) The second customer arrives at time 2, the chef takes his order and
 * starts preparing it at time 3, and finishes at time 8, so the waiting time
 * of the second customer is 8 - 2 = 6.
 * 3) The third customer arrives at time 4, the chef takes his order and starts
 * preparing it at time 8, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the
 * third customer is 11 - 4 = 7.
 * So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: customers = [[5,2],[5,4],[10,3],[20,1]]
 * Output: 3.25000
 * Explanation:
 * 1) The first customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts
 * preparing it immediately at time 5, and finishes at time 7, so the waiting
 * time of the first customer is 7 - 5 = 2.
 * 2) The second customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and
 * starts preparing it at time 7, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time
 * of the second customer is 11 - 5 = 6.
 * 3) The third customer arrives at time 10, the chef takes his order and
 * starts preparing it at time 11, and finishes at time 14, so the waiting time
 * of the third customer is 14 - 10 = 4.
 * 4) The fourth customer arrives at time 20, the chef takes his order and
 * starts preparing it immediately at time 20, and finishes at time 21, so the
 * waiting time of the fourth customer is 21 - 20 = 1.
 * So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 3.25.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= customers.length <= 10^5
 * 1 <= arrivali, timei <= 10^4
 * arrivaliÂ <= arrivali+1
 *
